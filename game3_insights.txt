Key Insight:
This is the formation the offense likes to line up in early in the downs and usually with more yards to go. Out of the 6 times, 5 were run on 1st or 2nd down with 6 or more yards to go. 3 of the 5 were run when it was 1st and 10.

Average team runs 60-70 offensiveplays per game, so identifying 10% of them as part of one group is pretty good
